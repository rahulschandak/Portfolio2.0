# Description

This project is my attempt to design a fully responsive website from scratch as a means to learn web development technologies like React, Node, Bootstrap, etc instead of using ready-made templates from the internet. It is a work-in-progress project and you can expect to see improvements in the near future.

It is live and hosted on [https://rahulchandak.netlify.app/](https://rahulchandak.netlify.app/)
